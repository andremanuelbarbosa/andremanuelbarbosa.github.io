This is a SWOT Analysis that I have made on Severn Trent Water in 2010/2011. Be aware that I am not by any means an economics expert and that the content displayed here might be out of date. Please validate the points listed below against the current situation of the organization before using them and take into account that these are merely the reflection of my personal opinion. Severn Trent Water is a member of the [Severn Trent Group](http://www.severntrent.co.uk/).

# Strengths
* Fourth largest private owned water supplier in the world and part of a reliable group of companies, the Severn Trent Plc;
* Supplies water to near 3.7 million households and near 8 million people, which places Severn Trent Water as one of the major water suppliers in the UK;
* Known for delivering high standard water, have been awarded distinctions for the freshness and good smell of their water;
* Investment made in cutting edge water processing technologies, innovative management tools and top of the art headquarters.

# Weaknesses
* Poor customer service, placing too often profit above clients satisfaction in the past, has damaged the relationship with their source of incomes;
* Failure to tackle repairs and leakages in the past affects the organization image and its current operational costs;
* Geographic limitation of operations, providing most of services to customers located in the Midlands of England and mid Wales;
* Bad reputation amongst governmental entities and sector regulators for hiding the truth and not being transparent about their operations.

# Opportunities
* Emergence of more efficient and environmental harmless techniques for water processing and filtering with lower carbon emission levels;
* Large number of tangible business areas within the United Kingdom and other countries in the world;
* Estimated and projected population of the United Kingdom growth to more than 70 millions in 2033 also increases the number of potential customers.

# Threats
* Climate changes are leading to severe weather conditions causing massive disruptions in service and falls in rivers flows;
* Strong regulations for the industry imposed by the European Union limit the enterprise growth and increase bills for the customers;
* High competitiveness within the water sector and possibilities of merges and acquisitions of other companies to overcome Severn Trent position.
