This is a TOWS Analysis that I have made on Toyota in 2010/2011. Be aware that I am not by any means an economics expert and that the content displayed here might be out of date. Please validate the points listed below against the current situation of the organization before using them and take into account that these are merely the reflection of my personal opinion. Toyota is a registered trademark of the [Toyota Motor Corporation](http://www.toyota.com/).

# Opportunities / Strengths
* Use its global presence and strength to increase the number of production plants and investments in emergent economies to extract all the potential that these countries represent;
* Continue the investment in the green engines and other innovations using its previous success with Prius as a reference for further developments and its research centers as a route to meet their expectations;
* Being the current leader in car sales and production, and benefiting from the predictions that the automotive market will keep growing at least in the short term future, Toyota has a great chance to reach even higher and gain a bigger advantage over the competition;
* The organization should also use its  leading and innovative production techniques to get a good place in the race for the market segments which their demand is still growing across several countries.

# Opportunities / Weaknesses
* Explore the fleet renewals schemes that are still active in some countries of the EU and maximize the number of vehicles sold through to gain a better position in the car sector for this region;
* Consider relocating some of the less effective manufacturing plants from Japan to emerging economies with low exchange rates to become more independent from their home nation economics and the Yen fluctuation;
* Predictions for increasing car sales give Toyota some confidence that, as long as the resources are distributed homogeneously throughout their car manufacturing plants, the amount of time that these facilities are not being used will be minimized.

# Threats / Strengths
* Innovation and a strong presence in the field of ecological engine allows Toyota to minimize the impact of the raising oil price and present their customers a strong alternative that is concerned with the environment;
* Strong internationalization and the emergence of new economies give the company the power to lower the influence of Yen and the Japanese government in their operations, by shifting a reasonable number of their operations to other locations;
* Combine some of the most innovate production techniques in the sector with the leading car manufacturer position to minimize the damages caused by the price competition in the car sales markets.

# Threats / Weaknesses
* The decision to move or not some of the manufacturing plants to emergent countries, mentioned before in this analysis, can became one of the most important strategies ever taken by the corporation, reducing the Japanese government decisions influence and decreasing the exposure to the Yen radical fluctuation;
* Mature markets saturation effect can be minimized by focusing on some specific segments like high standard cars, which at the same time help to build the high performance Toyota and Lexus brands awareness by some of their customers, with particular focus to Europe and North America.
