This is a Generic Strategies Analysis that I have made on Severn Trent Water in 2010/2011. Be aware that I am not by any means an economics expert and that the content displayed here might be out of date. Please validate the points listed below against the current situation of the organization before using them and take into account that these are merely the reflection of my personal opinion. Severn Trent Water is a member of the [Severn Trent Group](http://www.severntrent.co.uk/).

# Segmentation
* Not applicable for STW as their geographic scope is limited, and the target market is neither age or gender dependent;
* The main differentiation in the water sector is the household vs. business customers but no indications suggest that the organization acts different.

# Differentiation
* Their water has been considered the best in UK for several times and their intentions are to keep improving their water standards;
* Investments have been made by the organization in innovative methods of water processing and waste management for reaching high levels;
* STW aims to be the best water provider in UK and their commitment to this is evident as the standards are high and the prices low.

# Cost Leadership
* Increasing profits by reducing costs taking into consideration that STW provides some of the sector lowest average prices;
* Has moved to a new headquarters building in order to centralize their operations and minimize costs by sharing resources and being efficient;
* Access to the capital needed to invest in new technologies as part of the Severn Trent Plc which also includes a research sibling organization.
