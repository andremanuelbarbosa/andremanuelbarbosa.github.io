This is a SWOT Analysis that I have made on easyJet in 2010/2011. Be aware that I am not by any means an economics expert and that the content displayed here might be out of date. Please validate the points listed below against the current situation of the organization before using them and take into account that these are merely the reflection of my personal opinion. easyJet is a registered trademark of the [easyGroup IP Licensing Limited](http://www.easy.com/).

# Strengths
* Includes routes to major airports which is important for business passengers;
* Being a no frills airline is able to offer low prices to their customers;
* Most of the flights are booked online through their website, which also means low maintenance costs for the organization;
* Fast turn-around with their planes taking off within 30 minutes of landing;
* Distinctive brand using orange as their official color, memorable slogans like “The web's favorite airline” and featured on Airline TV series in UK;
* Young and modern fleet with an average plane age of 3.7 years and embracing some of the newest fuel efficient engines from General Electric;
* Benefits from low airport charges as does not require on ground management services for transfers or airports hubs for boarding.

# Weaknesses
* High-density seating which causes some discomfort for passengers during long distance flights and constraints an enjoyable flying experience;
* Reduced capabilities of airport bargaining as it operates on quite a large scale with central airports and less with small regional facilities;
* To much emphasis on the price strategy, which leaves the organization with a limited margin of operations and target markets.

# Opportunities
* The Pound weakening against the Euro increases the demand in travel from other European countries to United Kingdom;
* European Union under expansion bring new countries to the economic area and also possible targets for an increasing set of routes;
* There are still a lot of areas left to explored by easyJet like for example Eastern Europe and the Balkans, where the airline has a small or null influence;
* Major sports events are happening across Europe like London 2012 and the Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine and will originate an increase in demand;
* Economic problems in Europe are the same time a risk but also an incredible opportunity to grow as people will choose mostly the cheaper option.

# Threats
* Dependence on oil price and currencies exchange rates to maintain the profits high and maximize the number of flights;
* Increase of low cost airlines competition and existing monopoly in some areas like Central and parts of Eastern Europe;
* Ryanair, the largest low cost airline in Europe and main competitor of easyJet, offers a impressive set of routes and in some airports has beneficial treatment;
* European regulations limit the organization growth and affect revenue, from carbon emission levels control to passengers rights appeals;
* Customers awareness of price is tremendous and as long as there would be a cheaper option available, easyJet would not be chosen as their airline.
