This is a Five Forces Analysis that I have made on Severn Trent Water in 2010/2011. Be aware that I am not by any means an economics expert and that the content displayed here might be out of date. Please validate the points listed below against the current situation of the organization before using them and take into account that these are merely the reflection of my personal opinion. Severn Trent Water is a member of the [Severn Trent Group](http://www.severntrent.co.uk/).

# Potential Entrants
* Entering the water supplying sector is extremely complicated and involves larges amounts of investment in high technological equipment;
* The safest method of entering the sector is targeting large companies using another undertaker network and provide efficient administrative services.

# Suppliers
* Limited range of companies which are specialized in water processing engineering affects STW freedom of choice and bargaining;
* Severn and Trent, the rivers where the organization get most its water from are expected to decrease in flow over the next years and cause disruption.

# Substitutes
* There is no substitute for water in the world, is vital to all known forms of life and is required to be distributed to all households;
* Strong governmental regulations forbid retail and common carriage water distribution to household customers, which makes substitution impossible;
* Large consuming companies are allowed to switch their water supplier so STW must be aware and work towards a good customer service.

# Buyers
* Low decision power for customers since their options are limited to the water undertaker which is attached to their household;
* Just companies that use at least 50 mega litres of water a year can choose their water provider according to the Water Supply License;
* Prices and standards for the customers are determined by OFWAT, which encourages companies to reduce costs through comparative regulation.

# Competition
* Competition in the sector is almost inexistent and has strong regulations imposed by the Government and appointed inspection services;
* Retail competition is available since approved water suppliers can use STW network to distribute water to their own customers using different billing.
