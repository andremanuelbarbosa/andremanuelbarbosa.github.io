This is a Value Chain Analysis that I have made on Toyota in 2010/2011. Be aware that I am not by any means an economics expert and that the content displayed here might be out of date. Please validate the points listed below against the current situation of the organization before using them and take into account that these are merely the reflection of my personal opinion. Toyota is a registered trademark of the [Toyota Motor Corporation](http://www.toyota.com/).

# PRIMARY ACTIVITIES

## Inbound Logistics
* The raw material is purchased all over the world and distributed to the several manufacturing plants, also spread worldwide, dispatched using a strong set of resources located in different regions;
* Acquisition of the material is made according to the geographic location so that for example Chinese and other Asian factories are the main suppliers of the Japanese plants, in order to minimize transportation costs;
* Toyota is famous in the automotive sector for maintaining a good relationship with their suppliers and working together with them by establishing processes improvement to achieve the lowest costs possible;
* Just-in-Time approach has a strong influence in the cars manufacturing process so that raw material is ordered through automatic procedures that are triggered when stocks run low and these are delivered as soon as possible.

## Operations
* Toyota Production System (TPS) is the production control system used by the organization which aims to minimize the manufacturing waste by optimizing the processes used in car assembling lines and is a reference in the sector;
* One of the main characteristics of the TPS, beside the JiT approach, is that if a problem is detected during the manufacturing process the machine or system responsible must stop as soon as possible, also referred as Jidoka;
* Efficient and optimized processes are a constant in Toyota, which benefits from these innovative techniques throughout their 26 worldwide plants to deliver  their products at reduced costs and improve the car production standards.

## Outbound Logistics
* The car distribution is made by using its global presence in 170 countries all over the world, with the products being delivered to their destination from the closest plants as possible;
* Showrooms managed by Toyota are available in those countries, providing the connecting bridge between their products and potential customers, eliminating the sales middle man.

## Marketing and Sales
* Advertisement is one of the most important factors that made Toyota the largest car manufacturer in the world, with the transmission to the public of the brand name and its association with high standards vehicles;
* Participation in sports events to captivate their target audience like the presence in the Nascar races in USA and F1 in Europe helped the organization to expose its brand name but recent cuts have been made and this path was abandoned;
* Identification of niche markets either by geographic location, financial health or age range measures, is one of the success factors in the products distribution like the creation of the Lexus brand and the launch of Yaris in Europe.

## Service
* The car manufacturer has been facing some issues with a few defects in its cars and despite the costs, there have been several actions for re-calling all vehicles that might have the problems in question without governmental pressure;
* Innovation is an intrinsic concept in the corporation, not just in areas related to production but also in the training and motivation of their staff by the usage of new learning techniques to maintain the same production standard uniform;
* Customers are taken serious at Toyota, both in good times (sales) and less good (complains). Proof of that is for example what is mentioned above in the first point regarding the acknowledgment of errors and handling the consequences;
* Several repair units are spread across the world for after sales services, either belonging to the mother corporation or through partnerships with companies that have a good reputation in the target countries.


# SUPPORT ACTIVITIES

## Procurement
* Since the end of the 1990's and the beginning of the millennium, Toyota has embraced a commitment of outsourcing to more and more minority owned companies, becoming a leader in this approach to supplier development;
* In order to maintain high standard levels in the materials that are later used in the car manufacturing process, the organization adopted an active approach with their suppliers rather than a passive customer-supplier relationship;
* Joint ventures and the creation of manufacturing plants in emergent countries like China and Thailand were strategic decisions to lower the price as much as possible and continuous efforts are being made to keep them low.

## Technology Development
* Several research centers, located in different regions in the world, give Toyota the power to create innovative solutions and to gain competitive advantage in the tight automotive market;
* Prius, the first mass produced hybrid car in the world with a present total of two million units sold since it was first launched in 1998, is an example of how the organization benefits from its technological capabilities;
* The lean manufacturing model adopted by Toyota through the TPS is another reference of how much the technological development can contribute to the improvements in performance and cost reduction.

## Human Resources Management
* Human resources are assets an their handling is vital for an organization, but with a workforce of more than 300,000 members it is crucial for Toyota to have in place techniques to minimize the arising problems of such a large set;
* To better transmit the sense of corporate culture and that their employees has seen as human capital, the corporation has established for several years a large number of policies and behavioral principles;
* Training is provided on a frequent basis to maintain the levels of operational performance at a similar level throughout the different plants in the world and motivational methods are also in place all the time.

## Infrastructure
* Behind Toyota's manufacturing line are sophisticated information systems that support and enable the business processes that help the automaker eliminate waste, limit stock buildup and continue to improve production;
* The best example of the organization infrastructure importance is the linkage between all the production plants and the enterprise resource planning systems, responsible for keeping record of the orders and send them to the plants;
* There are in place a set of other management information systems that help the most distinct parts of the business like Marketing or Accounting departments to achieve their goals but is not relevant to describe them in detail for this case.
