This is a SWOT Analysis that I have made on Toyota in 2010/2011. Be aware that I am not by any means an economics expert and that the content displayed here might be out of date. Please validate the points listed below against the current situation of the organization before using them and take into account that these are merely the reflection of my personal opinion. Toyota is a registered trademark of the [Toyota Motor Corporation](http://www.toyota.com/).

# Strengths
* Global organization with a strong presence in several regions of the world (51 manufacturing companies in 26 countries plus 12 in Japan) and a brand name known worldwide (their vehicles are sold in more than 170 countries);
* Efficient and innovative production techniques with a particular emphasis on eliminating waste and the manufacturing process improvement has made Toyota a leader and a reference in the operations management field of studies;
* Collection of policies and principles at Toyota that embrace a rich corporate culture and transmit to the more than 300,000 human resources motivation and a feeling of cooperation to achieve outstanding results;
* Innovation in the creation and distribution of ecological engines with Toyota Prius being the first mass produced hybrid vehicle in the world and since then has seen its sales increasing year after year to a total of two millions in 2010;
* Investment in R&D has been one of the top priorities for the organization during several years across multiple areas and the prove of that is a reasonable amount of design and research centers spread all over the world;
* Leading car manufacturer both in production and sales in 2008, 2009 and, despite no significant gains, also in 2010, leaves Toyota in a stable financial situation with an operating income of 147.5 billion Yen for the FY2010.

# Weaknesses
* Exposure to the Yen exchange rate fluctuation and political conditions between Japan and other countries regarding global economic subjects puts Toyota in an unstable and unpredictable financial situation;
* Considerable high number of manufacturing facilities across the world that are expensive to maintain and represent a serious problem when production has to be reduced or stopped due to an economic slowdown for example;
* Problems with vehicles like the one in 2009 with the accelerators cause in a short term huge financial due to the large scale re-call and are a threat to the brand image in a medium to long term, resulting in potential losses in incomes.

# Opportunities
* Emerging countries like Brazil, India, Russia and China, which together add up to a total population close to 3 billion people, are markets that have not been explored and present a huge investment potential for the organization;
* Growing number of environmental restrictions and increasing fuel prices have been and will keep pushing Toyota to produce cars more fuel efficient, with greater performance and less impact on the environment;
* Fleet renewal schemes were and are being adopted by governments across several countries from the EU in order to reduce the average cars age in their territories, which encourages people to get new vehicles;
* Despite some turbulence in the automotive sector over a recent past, the global car sales figures have been growing during the last two decades and predictions are that these numbers will beat records high in 2011;
* Demand for luxury cars is increasing specially in emergent economies like China, Russia and India but also in the United States thanks in part to the growing number of new business man and women in those countries.

# Threats
* Large percentage of Toyota production originates in Japan and a continuous and radical appreciation of the Yen is causing difficulties in the process of exporting their cars to other locations in the world;
* Economic slowdown across several major economies in the world, including regions like North America, Europe and East Asia, with severe negative impact in the automotive sector demand and sales;
* Rising oil prices has been a constant phenomenon and has placed the value of crude in record highs, causing a considerable increase in the amount of people that decided to choose alternative methods of transportation;
* Decision to reduce the amount of subsidies for fleet renewals and environment friend cars purchases or complete abandon of such policies by the governments of several countries like Japan, Austria, Italy and Germany;
* Strong economic tension between EU, USA and Japan regarding the approach to the imports and exports balance equilibrium and an increasing number of laws governing these operations puts Toyota in a tough situation;
* Tight and sometimes aggressive competition across the automotive sector and in particular for the developed markets, has been causing dangerous decreases in the prices and compromising the organization's financial balance;
* Cheaper small cars made in emerging economies like China, India and Eastern Europe force large manufactures like Toyota and Nissan to put prices down and present a serious risk to these companies financial situation
* Saturation of the mature markets like Japan, USA and Europe is a phenomenon that is connected to reduction in car demand and consequent losses in sales and affects Toyota and other large car manufacturers.
