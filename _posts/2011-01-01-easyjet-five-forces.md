This is a Five Forces Analysis that I have made on easyJet in 2010/2011. Be aware that I am not by any means an economics expert and that the content displayed here might be out of date. Please validate the points listed below against the current situation of the organization before using them and take into account that these are merely the reflection of my personal opinion. easyJet is a registered trademark of the [easyGroup IP Licensing Limited](http://www.easy.com/).

# Potential Entrants
* easyJet is the second largest low budget airline in Europe in fleet size and number of routes with the first place belonging to Ryanair;
* Large frill airlines attempting to enter the low cost market using some one or more partners like for example Air France and Flybe;
* Most of the slots are taken in major airports or are too expensive to be considered a good investment for Ryanair;
* Limited carbon emission levels per year for an airline like for example Ryanair has seen the number of passengers in London cut off;
* When two or more budget airlines are operating on the same route the price war is intense and sometimes prejudicial to the organization.

# Suppliers
* Airbus is the main supplier of aircraft to easyJet;
* The number of airplanes suppliers is limited to Airbus and Boeing and switching between them involves costs because pilots need training;
* Strong dependency on the oil price but using a hedging policy to reduce the impacts of the price flotation;
* In most cases the margin of airport bargaining is small for easyJet as it operates in central airports rather than regional.

# Substitutes
* The number of high speed trains is growing across Europe and in some cases like Eurostar or TGV, the time difference is not that big;
* No brand loyalty or close customer relationship as easyJet focus most of its strategy on price rather than high standard customer service.

# Buyers
* Level of price awareness is high and most of the times this is the main reason in the customer decision process to choose easyJet;
* Switching to a different airline is simple and does not involve additional costs as long as the same route is offered for a smaller price;
* Customers are aware that no frill means no commodities and no special treatment but if the price is not the lowest, there is also no loyalty.

# Competitive Rivalry
* The low cost market is very competitive and most of the packages that are offered to the customer are fairly easy to match;
* Most of the times easyJet routes do not collide with their competitors in order to avoid the price battle until the minimal profit available;
* When routes overlaying occurs, the customer is the one that benefits from a the price war but easyJet does not gain much from this;
* For this specific market there are not many differentiators between the companies as the price or the route itself dictate the customer decision.
