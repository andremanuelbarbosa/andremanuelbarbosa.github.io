This is a TOWS Analysis that I have made on easyJet in 2010/2011. Be aware that I am not by any means an economics expert and that the content displayed here might be out of date. Please validate the points listed below against the current situation of the organization before using them and take into account that these are merely the reflection of my personal opinion. easyJet is a registered trademark of the [easyGroup IP Licensing Limited](http://www.easy.com/).

# Opportunities / Strengths
* Create routes in Eastern Europe and the Balkans using some of their low cost strategies to enter those regions;
* More advertising focus on business flights between Europe and the UK to respond to the Pound value drop;
* Associate the dynamic brand name to the major sports events in Europe either by a partnership or deals with the events organization.

# Opportunities / Weaknesses
* Take advantage of the Euro 2012 to secure some bargaining deals with airports in Poland and Ukraine and gain some regional expansion;
* Use the unstable economic situation to gain some customers through a B2B approach by offering exclusive business packages to companies.

# Threats / Strengths
* Increase the investment in becoming as green as possible not only for the airline image but also to meet the EU carbon emission levels limits;
* Use the brand name to provide their customers a benefits membership card to minimize the impact of the lack of loyalty and price focus;
* Launch promotional deals for routes in areas so far vastly dominated by their competitors and keep the prices as low as possible onwards.

# Threats / Weaknesses
* Create an easyJet advantage card that benefits the customers and releases some pressure from the price focused strategy;
* Introducing routes to some regional destinations would allow easyJet to raise Ryanair awareness and promote additional competition.
